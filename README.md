# LIA


**L**ocation. **I**nformation. **A**ction. - Know your neighborhood's ordinances.

## Introduction

**LIA** is a simple tool that gives you information on the ordinances being implemented on your neighboorhood.

* **Relevant**: Each ordinance is placed in a location where most violations happen, thus it becomes relevant to each user.
* **Accessible**: You can access LIA from either your desktop or through your tablet device.
* **HTML5-Compatible**: LIA is using UIKit , one of the latest HTML5 Frameworks available; and LeafletJS , a modern open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. This means that LIA can be viewed using modern broswers available on the market.
* **Fork-able**: LIA is under the MIT License , which means you can make your own LIA for your specified neighborhood. We have a simple development guide which will help you to do so.
