March 7 (initial) -  Added Homepage, modified App to have off-canvas sidebar. Refurbished map script. Added ordinances.js
March 7 (5:06pm) - still can't figure how to make the search function work amidst its compatibility in the browser.
March 11 (7:22am) - Moved inline JS to individual js files
March 11 (4:05pm) - will be adding `./src/map/map.js`,  and `./src/map/loc.js` to git repo
March 12 (1:58am) - modified `app.htm`, `database/loc.js` and `index.htm`. updated uikit js file to stop showing more results. removing `uikit.js` in existence of `uikit.min.js`. renamed `database/data.json` to `search.json` for formality. `loc.js` now has a map showing the border of the municipality. created `database/plot.js` so that the map borders won't be affected. modified credits on `app.htm`. added `humans.txt`. 
March 12 (3:12am) - `index` is 85% complete. `app` is 65% complete
March 14 (3:05am) - changed `plot.js`, `style.css`, `ordinances.js` and added a backup called `ords.js`.
March 14 (3:14am) - changed `index.htm` and `app.htm`, added meta tags
March 15 (1:55am) - as suggested by colleague, expand sidebar's `.uk-offcanvas-bar` to 480px. changed `src/map/leaflet.css` set `.leaflet-content` to 200px due to how long the ordinances were. about the search function, GitHub's nginx engine doesn't allow XMLHttpRequests so we have to deal with it. tweaked `app` a bit.
March 15 (3:00am) - learned about `<details>` and `<summary>`, modified `ordinances.js` and `app` as well.
March 15 (3:00am) - map changed from polygon to polyline.
March 15 (5:29pm)- removed search function due to complications in GitHub's servers, as it does not accept XHR.
